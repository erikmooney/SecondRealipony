INTRODUCTION
============

Second Realipony is a remake of the legendary classic PC animation demo Second Reality by Future Crew. Ponified, with characters and themes from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.

It is written in C# using the Microsoft XNA game development engine.

The code may be reused and redistributed as per the included MIT License.  The artwork assets are NOT included in this license and may NOT be reused or redistributed without permission from the original artists.  See my page at http://www.dos486.com/secondrealipony for a list of the artwork and artists.


REQUIREMENTS
============

Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.  I used the free C# Express edition for development.  Professional and higher versions should also work.

Microsoft XNA Game Studio 4.0.


MUSIC
=====

I have chosen NOT to include Future Crew's original music, for reasons of copyright and also file size.  Included are just very short placeholder .wav files with the same names, so that the code can run.  For any projects derived from this, you will need to supply your own music.
